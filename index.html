		<h2>My Family</h2>
			<p>I come from a large family. I have 1 sister, 2 parents, 3 uncles, 1 aunt, and 9 first cousins. When I was six my parents got divorced but they shared custody half time and half time so I was able to see them equally. It was hard for them to raise my sister and I as single parents but they managed to get through it. The good thing is that they still get along good and they do not argue as much.</p>
